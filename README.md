## Creating a Venn Diagram in R

### Synopsis
A PCA plot looks for variance and patterns in multi-dimensional data, and plotting this data in a less-dimensional space without losing information.  In the iris dataset, a matrix of eigenvalues are calculated from the the covariance of two features: petal length, sepal width, sepal length, or petal width; from categorizations setosa, verisocolor, and virginica. Eigenvectors from the dataset determine the direction of the feature space.

The code is contained in the R script [Create_PCA_Plot.R](https://github.com/scienceystuff/Create_PCA_in_R/blob/master/Create_PCA_Plot.R), which can be opened and run in R or R Studio.
